## Reporting bugs

It is inevitable that code will have bugs. There are a few things you can do to
help the maintainer to fix the bug that you've discovered quicker:

* Include the version of the Driver, PHP and Cassandra.
* Include the Driver dependency versions as well (e.g. libuv, C/C++ Driver, ...etc)
* Include a complete stack trace of the failure as well as any available logs.
* Include any additional information you think is relevant - the description of
  your setup, any non-default Driver configuration, etc.
